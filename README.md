## Evaluate web pages within a three-hop distance from the home page on Archive. Today and Trova 

So, we started things off by exploring web pages on Archive.today and Trove, just a few hops away from their main pages. Our toolkit included WAVE, IBM Equal Accessibility Checker, and AI Inspector. 

First things first, we took a good look at both Archive.today and Trove websites to get a sense of what's happening in those pages. Then, we got down to using the WAVE tool to gather data for each hop. We did this for 30 hops on Archive.today and another 30 on Trove, all with  WAVE tool. 

To keep things organized, we created a document and inserted screenshots of those 30 hops from both Archive.today and Trove. These screenshots give us a visual breakdown of each hop along with a summary and details. 

Moving on, we didn't stop at WAVE and we brought in two more tools - IBM Equal Accessibility Checker and AI Inspector. We ran these on each hop from both Trove and Archive.today. we exported the files and neatly stored the data in Excel files. 

Our document also did some detective work, identifying issues and jotting them down in an Excel sheet, noting how often they appeared. We took it a step further and checked if these issues were hanging out across different web archives like Wayback Machine, UK Web Archive, Trove, Pandora, and Archive.today. 

All in all, it was a journey through web pages, tools, and data, and now we've got the insights neatly laid out for review.
