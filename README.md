## Accessibility Unlocked: Enhancing Web Usability with AXE DevTools and LLMs
## Introduction : 
The objective of this project is to identify and categorize accessibility issues in web-archived data across a variety of categories, using AXE DevTools Chrome Extension. Given the importance of web accessibility, ensuring archived websites meet accessibility standards is crucial for inclusivity and legal compliance. This project aims to analyze archived websites, detect accessibility errors, and organize the results in a structured manner. Accessibility on the web ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can navigate and interact with websites. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are the industry standard for web accessibility, covering a range of requirements to make websites usable for people with disabilities. Deque Systems' Axe DevTools is a tool designed to identify accessibility issues in websites. By analyzing archived websites with Axe DevTools, we can pinpoint areas where older websites may fall short of current accessibility standards.
Blind individuals often face significant challenges when navigating the web, especially when revisiting past web content. This project aims to explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve accessibility for blind users and understand their preferences, challenges, and needs. We seek to evaluate how conversational AI systems and LLMs can be adapted to assist blind individuals in accessing web archives and finding reliable information. Moreover, Blind users rely heavily on assistive technologies like screen readers and voice assistants for accessing web content. However, these technologies often fall short in providing seamless navigation, especially with older or complex web content. As LLMs become more advanced, they could offer a more user-friendly and intuitive approach for blind users to access information and improve their well-being.
Evaluate web pages within a three-hop distance from the home page on Archive.Today and Trova .

we have conducted analyses on each hop from both Archive. Today. Exporting the data generated by IBM Equal Accessibility Checker, WAVE tool ,AI Inspector and storing it neatly in Excel files. After understanding the structure and content of the web pages on Archive. Today and Trove, the next step is to conduct an analysis to check if the identified issues were present across different web archives. These archives could include the Wayback Machine, UK Web
Archive, Trove, Pandora, and Archive. Today. This analysis involves comparing the same web pages across different archives to identify any discrepancies or issues.
Once the analysis is complete, the results need to be documented in form of excel. This involves writing a detailed report that outlines the methodology used for the analysis, the findings, and any conclusions or recommendations. The report should be written in a clear oand concise manner, making it easy for others to understand the work that has been done.

Methodology
## Data Collection
The project involved selecting archived websites across a wide range of categories. We used the Web Archive platform to access these archived websites and generate accessibility reports with the Axe DevTools Chrome Extension. The websites were chosen based on popularity and user count, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive dataset.
We ran a study with 14 blind people to learn about their experiences with conversational AI and their needs when going back to old web content. First, we collected some basic information about them. Then, we talked to them about Large Language Models (LLMs) and asked what they thought about chatbots and other AI systems—what they liked, what problems they faced, and how they thought things could be better.
To understand how they navigate old web content, we asked them questions about what they need when revisiting past websites. We also asked about the types of content they found most helpful and the tools they used. These answers will help us see how LLMs can make things easier and better for blind users.
Research Approach
To address the problem statement, we conducted a user study with blind participants, aiming to collect insights on their interaction with LLMs and how they access past web content. The study was divided into two parts: conversational AI and web archive interactions. We designed questions to gather information about their experiences, preferences, challenges, and suggestions for improvement.
## Categorization
To maintain consistency, we categorized the websites into 24 distinct categories, each containing 50 websites. This categorization allowed for a systematic approach to data collection and analysis. The categories included:
●	Arts Entertainment

●	Business and Consumer Services

●	Community and Society

●	Computers, Electronics, and Technology

●	E-commerce and Shipping

●	Education

●	Finance

●	Food and Drinks

●	Gambling

●	Games

●	Government

●	Heavy Industry and Engineering

●	Hobbies and Leisure

●	Home and Garden

●	Jobs and Careers

●	Law and Government

●	Lifestyle

●	News and Media Publishers

●	Pets and Animals

●	Reference Materials

●	Science and Education

●	Sports

●	Travel and Tourism

●	Vehicles

## Accessibility Analysis
●	For each archived website, we used the Axe DevTools Chrome Extension to conduct accessibility tests. 

●	The tool generates a detailed JSON report containing information about accessibility issues, including the location of the problem on the website, applicable WCAG rules, and recommended solutions. 

●	We generated over 27,000 JSON files representing these accessibility reports.

●	We transcribed the recorded conversations and categorized the responses to identify common themes and insights.

●	We analyzed the data to understand the blind users' experiences with LLMs and their requirements for accessing past web content.

●	We documented the findings to create a comprehensive case study on the interactions with LLMs and web archive

 

## Implementation Details
# Evaluate web pages within a three-hop distance from the home page on Archive. Today and Trova 

So, we started things off by exploring web pages on Archive.today and Trove, just a few hops away from their main pages. Our toolkit included WAVE, IBM Equal Accessibility Checker, and AI Inspector. 

First things first, we took a good look at both Archive.today and Trove websites to get a sense of what's happening in those pages. Then, we got down to using the WAVE tool to gather data for each hop. We did this for 30 hops on Archive.today and another 30 on Trove, all with  WAVE tool. 

To keep things organized, we created a document and inserted screenshots of those 30 hops from both Archive.today and Trove. These screenshots give us a visual breakdown of each hop along with a summary and details. 

Moving on, we didn't stop at WAVE and we brought in two more tools - IBM Equal Accessibility Checker and AI Inspector. We ran these on each hop from both Trove and Archive.today. we exported the files and neatly stored the data in Excel files. 

Our document also did some detective work, identifying issues and jotting them down in an Excel sheet, noting how often they appeared. We took it a step further and checked if these issues were hanging out across different web archives like Wayback Machine, UK Web Archive, Trove, Pandora, and Archive.today. 

All in all, it was a journey through web pages, tools, and data, and now we've got the insights neatly laid out for review. 
After generating the JSON files, we organized them by category and website. Each JSON file was renamed to represent the year of the archived data. This systematic approach facilitated easy access to specific datasets for analysis and comparison.
The Axe DevTools Chrome Extension identifies accessibility issues with 100% certainty, reducing false positives. The JSON files were downloaded for each website, allowing further research and data manipulation. By generating accessibility reports, we ensured that each archived website's accessibility issues were identified, documented, and made available for further research and improvement.
Challenges Encountered
One of the challenges encountered was accessing archived websites with varying levels of responsiveness and loading times. Additionally, some older websites lacked compatibility with modern testing tools, requiring adjustments in the data collection process. We addressed these challenges by using a flexible testing approach, ensuring consistent results.
Conversational AI with LLMs

●	We provided a brief explanation of LLMs to the participants, describing them as advanced chatbots that can understand and respond to questions.

●	We asked a series of questions about their interactions with conversational AI, focusing on trust, human-like qualities, needs, and concerns regarding biases and stereotypes.

## Web Archive Navigation
●	We explored how blind users access past web content and the tools they use, focusing on screen readers and voice assistants.

●	We asked questions about the types of content they found most valuable and informative, their preferred devices for accessing past content, and the features or tools they found most helpful.

●	We addressed challenges and barriers faced by blind users when revisiting past web content, including usability, accessibility, and security.

The Topic wise questions asked to the blind people.
